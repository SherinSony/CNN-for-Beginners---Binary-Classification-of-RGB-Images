# CNN-for-Beginners---Binary-Classification-of-RGB-Images

Hi Friends

Just like all new Data Scientists and Machine Learning Lovers, I read through a lot of Blogs and the Videos by many Universities before coming up with this model of a CNN architecture for classifying a very common problem of :
Classifying RGB ( Reg Green Blue or Color) Images of Santa Claus 

I have tried tp use the best practices in CNN for Computer Vision as per University lectures in 2017.

Setup of the environment:
Please have 1 Main folder like I have : D:\DL\image-classification-keras\image-classification-keras\images ,  with 2 sub-folders with respective type of Images : santa , not_santa
Please have another folder like I have for the final test images: D:\DL\image-classification-keras\image-classification-keras\Val_examples
Please feel free to play around with the layers available in Keras documentation too !

Happy Learning !
